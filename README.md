# To-Do List App

This is a simple To-Do List application built with React. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The app also supports dark mode and saves tasks to the browser's local storage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Add a Task**: Users can input a new task and add it to the list.
- **Edit a Task**: Existing tasks can be edited.
- **Delete a Task**: Users can remove tasks from the list.
- **Mark as Complete**: Tasks can be marked as complete or undone.
- **Dark Mode**: Switch between light and dark mode.
- **Persistent Data**: Tasks are saved to the browser's local storage, ensuring data persistence across page reloads.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the app and making it responsive.
- **localStorage**: For saving tasks to the user's browser.
- **React Icons**: For icons (used in the theme toggle button).
